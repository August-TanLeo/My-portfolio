                <p>Hi, I'm Taneesha and welcome to my professional space! <br>
                    I made this blog to track my journey, reflect on what I learn, and share ideas that matter to me.
                    It’s a mix of science, thought pieces, experiments, and whatever else I’m figuring out as I go.</p>

                    <h2>WHO I AM</h2>
                    <p>Beyond academics and aspirations, I’m someone who’s genuinely
                        curious about how things work, especially when it comes to the
                        human body and the systems that shape our world.
                        I’m interested in medicine, neuroscience, and the intersection of
                        science with technology and people.
                        This page is a closer look at who I am, what drives me, what I
                        care about, and what I hope to create as I grow.</p>

                            Long-term, I’d love to work at the intersection of science, innovation, and real-world impact.</p>
